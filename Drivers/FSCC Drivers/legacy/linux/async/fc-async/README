Installation Instructions for Commtech's Async adapters using the 8250 serial 
architecture.

1.0 Gone are the days of applying a patch to the kernel source and rebuilding
    the whole thing.  Now we have a kernel module that will attach all of our
    current Async ports to the default Linux serial driver.

    To use this kernel module simply change to the fc-async directory and 
    type:

        make
        sudo insmod fc-async.ko

    You can verify that the new ports were detected by checking the message log

        tail /var/log/messages

    you will see something like one of these:

        ttyS4 at I/O 0xd000 (irq = 177) is a 16C950/954
        ttys5 at MMIO 0xd0004800 (irq = 21) is a 16550A

    for each of your newly discovered Fastcom ports.

1.1 If you do not see any ports or if you do not see enough ports, it may
    be that your kernel's defaults are set to only detect a too-small
    number of serial ports.  This can be verified by looking at your
    current configuration file usually found at /boot/config-*
    Look for the defines for: CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS & 
    CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS.

    If either of these numbers is smaller than the total number of serial ports
    in the system (including the reserved ttyS0-3) then you will have trouble.

    You can change the number of UARTs by modifying your grub config's kernel
    line to say: 8250.nr_uarts=16 (or whatever number you like).

    Alternatively you could recompile your kernel with those two config
    lines modified appropriately.  

1.2 If you would like to keep up with the most recent changes, you may always 
    obtain the latest source for fc-async from the Google Code repo found at: 

        http://hg.commtech-fastcom.com/fc-async

    Alternatitively you can clone the repo using Mercurial:

        hg clone http://hg.commtech-fastcom.com/fc-async fc-async
