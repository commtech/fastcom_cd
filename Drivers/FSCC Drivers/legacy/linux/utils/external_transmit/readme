The external_transmit.c example expects that you have configured
the port (using setfscc and setclock etc. or similar)
It does not do any configuration simply sets up the external transmit mode
and sends data.

the extx_m.c is a similar example but it is monolithic, and does
not expect the port to be setup prior to its execution.
It configures the clock, sets the registers, configures external transmit mode
and then sends data. It is an "all in one" example.
It configures the port to use a 1Mbps data rate.
Transparent mode (raw bits output)
Clock mode 7 (internal clocking)
receiver disabled (no RX)
idle=1's
no sync, no term
NRZ line encoding
LSB data 
Frame sync pulse at beginning of data output
External Signal is CTS
