For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.

There are serveral example programs/utilities that can be found in the utils
directory.  If you have run make tools or make install, the compiled binaries
are located in the utils/bin directory.  To install any of these utilities just 
move them to one of your PATH directories or update your path to include this 
directory.

1.0 INITIALIZE THE FSCC

    Each time the driver is loaded, the board/port must be initialized prior to 
    use.  To initialize a port, you must do at least three things: 
	1) Set the clock
	2) Set configurations
        3) set the board features register to select ASYNC or SYNC operation
    This can be done in your program's code, or using the following utilities:

1.1 FSCCP CLOCK

    Program to set the main clock generator for the Fsccp channel.

	$ ./setclock 0 frequency [ppm]


1.2 FSCCP SETTINGS

    The setfscc program will setup the board's configuration. 

    Look at the set files (hdlcset, asyncset, bisyncset) that are included in 
    the directory of setfscc. Modify these files to your liking.

	$ ./setfscc 0 hdlcset

1.3 Board Features
    the getfeatures/setfeatures programs will configure the on board features register to 
    select either SYNC or ASYNC mode operation, and the RS-485 control for the transmitters (SD & TT)
    and the receive echo cancel feature.
     
        $ ./setfeatures 0 0 0 0 0

    the useage is "setfeatures port RXECHO SD485 TT485 ASYNC"
    a value of 0 disables the feature, a 1 enables the feature.
    the command line above will configure FSCC port 0 to not use RX echo cancel(RX always on),
    enable the transmitters all the time (RS-422), and switch to SYNC mode operation.
    If you have patched the 8250_pci.c kernel serial driver to allow ttySx access to the async ports on 
    the FSCC card then the default will be ASYNC operation, you can/must change it using this function
    if you want to use the port as a SYNC port.
    If you have not patched the kernel then the default will be SYNC operation.

2.0 TESTING THE FSCC INSTALL

    After building the driver and the example programs, you can test the 
    installation of the card.  To do so you will need to build a loop back 
    plug that connects the transmitter and receiver of a port together.
    Refer to the hardware manul found on your CD at:

	/fastcom_manuals/fsccp.pdf

    When you have the loop back built and installed, you can test port 0:

	$ cd /utils/bin
	$ ./setclock 0 6000000
	$ ./setfscc 0 hdlcset
        $ ./setfeatures 0 0 0 0 0
	$ ./rdwr 0 0 1022 h

    Port 1:

	$ ./setclock 1 6000000
	$ ./setfscc 1 hdlcset
        $ ./setfeatures 1 0 0 0 0
	$ ./rdwr 1 1 1024 h
