# Read
The `size` argument of the various read functions means different things depending
on the mode you are using.

In a frame based mode the `size` argument specifies the maximum frame `size` to 
return. If the next queued frame is larger than the size you specified the error 
`FSCC_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` is returned and the data will remain waiting for a read 
of a larger value. If a `size` is specified that is larger than the length of 
multiple frames in queue, you will still only receive one frame per read call.

In streaming mode (no frame termination) the `size` argument specifies the
maximum amount of data to return. If there are 100 bytes of streaming data
in the card and you read with a `size` of 50, you will receive 50 bytes.
If you do a read of 200 bytes, you will receive the 100 bytes available.

Frame based data and streaming data are kept separate within the driver.
To understand what this means, first imagine the following scenario. You are in a
frame based mode and receive a couple of frames. You then switch to
streaming mode and receive a stream of data. When calling read
you will receive the the streaming data until you switch back into a frame based
mode and do a read.

Most users will want the advanced I/O capabilities included by using the Windows
[OVERLAPPED I/O API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686358.aspx). 
We won't duplicate the documentation here, but for your reference, here is an [article]
(http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/02/02/10123392.aspx) on a common
bug developers introduce while trying to cancel I/O operations when using OVERLAPPED I/O.
